# Poe Root Helper

Poe Root Helper is a simple Windows Forms application designed to help memorize the leveling root in Path of Exile. It was created using .NET 7.0.

## Purpose

The purpose of this application is to help users memorize the leveling root in Path of Exile. As the developer did not have a second monitor and was still in the process of remembering the root, this application was created as a solution to avoid the need to alt+tab or constantly refer to a guide on a phone.

## How to Use

The application is controlled using buttons 4 and 5 on the mouse, which are the back and next step buttons respectively. The leveling guide used for this application can be found at https://www.poe-vault.com/guides/quick-reference-leveling-guide-act-1.

## Features

Currently, the application includes basic functionality to navigate the leveling guide. However, there are several features that could be added to improve the user experience, including:

- Adding color highlighting for certain text, such as areas, quest items, NPCs, and TP.
- Adding settings to allow users to customize key binds.
- Implementing screen text detection to automate the process.
- Refactor the code

## Installation

To install the application, simply download the latest zip file from the release tab or build it yourself. The program is portable, so it can be unzipped and used immediately.
